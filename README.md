# Machine Learning Projects: Datasets and Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing hands-on experience with machine learning using popular datasets and the scikit-learn framework. The notebooks cover basic analysis, visualization, regression, and classification tasks on three commonly used datasets: Boston Housing, Iris, and Breast Cancer.

## Datasets

### 1. Boston Housing Dataset
- **Description**: This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts.
- **Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) including statistical summaries and visualizations to understand relationships between various features and house prices.
- **Datset**: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html

### 2. Iris Dataset
- **Description**: A classic dataset for classification, it consists of measurements of various iris flowers.
- **Analysis**: EDA to explore the distribution of iris species and their characteristics. Classification models are built to predict the species based on petal and sepal measurements.
- **Datset**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris

### 3. Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Description**: This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to classify whether the mass is benign or malignant.
- **Analysis**: EDA to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with cancer type. Classification models are trained to predict the malignancy of breast masses.
- **Datset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

## Notebooks

1. **Boston_Housing_Analysis.ipynb**: Analysis and regression on the Boston Housing dataset.
2. **Iris_Classification.ipynb**: Classification of the three iris species using the Iris dataset.
3. **Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb**: Classification of breast masses as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer dataset.
