# Machine Learning Projects: Datasets and Analysis

This repository provides Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) tasks on classic datasets. It empowers you to delve into fundamental concepts, experiment with diverse algorithms, and gain practical experience in building ML models.

## Notebooks

- **Boston_Housing_Analysis.ipynb:** Explore the Boston Housing dataset, perform EDA, and build a regression model to predict house prices.
- **Iris_Classification.ipynb:** Analyze the Iris dataset, visualize data, train a classification model to distinguish between the three iris species.
- **Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb:** Investigate the Breast Cancer dataset, apply EDA, and create a classification model to classify breast masses.
- **wine_quality_dataset.ipynb:** Experiment with PyTorch, use the Wine Quality dataset to build a regression model for predicting wine quality.
- **torch_vision_on_FashionMNIST.ipynb:** Employ PyTorch for computer vision, train a CNN model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to classify clothing types.

**Datasets Included**

- **Boston Housing:** Analyze socioeconomic factors affecting house prices.
- **Iris:** Classify three iris species based on their petal and sepal measurements.
- **Breast Cancer (Wisconsin Diagnostic Protein Dataset):** Classify breast masses as benign or malignant using protein analysis.
- **Wine Quality:** Predict wine quality using a PyTorch regression model.
- **Fashion-MNIST:** Classify clothing types using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with PyTorch.
